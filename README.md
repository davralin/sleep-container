# sleep-container

A simple container, meant for continous staying awake (by sleeping) - perfect for just having a shell with editing tools.
This repo is mirrored from my selfhosted gitea-instance. I won't migrate or delete this repository, but it serves more as a backup.

Credits for the idea goes to wardsco/sleep
